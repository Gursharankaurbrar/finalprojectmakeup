# Description
Glam Guide is a modern makeup guide app dedicated to empowering young females to embrace their unique styles. It utilizes the Makeup API to display makeup
products from various brands. The app will categorize items into sections such as lipsticks, nail polishes, and foundations, to
ensure easy navigation. Users will be able to filter products based on brand, type, and other attributes. The makeup industry is vast, with so many products
available online, which makes it overwhelming and hard for users to make decisions. This leads to time-consuming searches.
Glam Guide offers solution to such problems by combining different product information in one place , which can help consumers make informed purchasing decisions quickly. By
categorizing products and providing brand-based filtering, users can explore and compare cosmetics easily and efficiently.
